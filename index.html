            <h3 class="about">About Me:</h3>
            <p>Hello! My name is Edgardo and I am self taught programmer. 
    
                I was born and raised in Los Angeles. I am the youngest sibling of four.
                I am a first generation Mexican-American and I enjoy sports, 
                movies, and spending time with my family. After high school 
                I attened Brown University in Rhode Island where I studied economics. Upon graduation
                I returned home to Los Angeles where I worked in food and 
                beverage at a company called Levy Restaurants as an Accounts Payable Clerk. 
                After 2 years at Levy, I went on to work at a maintenance company where 
                I was a scheduler, supervisor and bookkeeper. 
                <br>
                After a few years, I decided it was time for a change. My journey began in 
                March of 2022 after meeting up with a good friend 
                from college who first sparked the idea to make a career change.
                Shout out to my boy Mario Vega for introducing me to the world of programming. 
                With a mentor in my corner and my determination to learn this new skill, 
                I decided to bet on myself and embark on my long journey of becoming a programmer.
                <br>
                Fast forward 7 month and I have to admit, it's been harder than I expected! And at
                times I've grown impatient and even thought about just giving up.
                But I'm still here! Still at it! Little by little. One day at a time, 
                one line of code at a time.
                <br>
                I've come to realize that learning to code is very similar to my fitness journey:
                If you're doing it right, it's a life long process. There is always something new to learn.
                Something new to implement or something you can improve on or get stonger at.
                <!--Knowing that, helps me in times of frustration or when I feel like my
                progress is moving too slow. But so far, I've gotten approximately
                30% of the way through the Full Stack Course on Codecademy and my current project is
                to build my personal website. So here it is! What do you think??
                
                Feel free to leave me a comment on how I can improve this site! -->
                          
                I hope to continue learning front-end developement skills and hope to persue an entry
                level job in wed design within in the next 6-8 months.
