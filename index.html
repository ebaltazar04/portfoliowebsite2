        <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Edgardo and I am self taught programmer. 
                My journey began in March of 2022 after meeting up with a good friend 
                from college who inspired me to make a career change. 
                But before I get to that, first let me tell you a bit about who I am. 
                I was born and raised in Los Angeles. I am the youngest sibling of four.
                I am a first generation Mexican-American and I enjoy sports, 
                movies, and spending time with my family. After high school 
                I attened Brown University where I studied economics. Upon graduation
                I returned home to Los Angeles where I worked in food and 
                beverage at a company called Levy Restaurants as an Accounts Payable Clerk. 
                After 2 years at Levy, I went on to work at a Property Management company where 
                I was a supervisor for the maintenance department. 
                <br>
                After 4 long years, I finally decided that I needed to make a change:
                I was going to teach myself to program! Shout out to my boy Mario Vega for putting
                me up on game when it comes to programming and making me realize that I can too
                can learn to code if I put in the time and effort. With a mentor in my corner
                and my determination to get away from a paycheck to paycheck lifestyle, 
                I decided to bet on myself and embark on my long journey of becoming a programmer.
                <br>
                Now I have to admit, it has been harder and taken longer than I expected but I'm still at it.
                It's comforting to know that learning to code is very similar to working out:
                It's a life long journer, it's truly never ending. There is always something new
                to learn. Knowing that, helps me in times of frustration when I feel like I'm
                learning to slow or don't understand a topic. But so far, I've gotten approximately
                30% of the way through the Full Stack Course on Codecademy and my current project is
                to build my personal website. So here it is! What do you think??
                <br>
                Feel free to leave me a comment on how I can improve this site!
                <br>           
                I hope to continue learning front-end developement skills and hope to persue an entry
                level job in wed design within in the next 6-8 months.</p>

                <h4>Website Style Guide (HTML/CSS)</h4>
                <img src="">
                    <figcaption>This project was my first attempt at using HTML and CSS to come up with Style Guide for a future personal website</figcaption>
                <h4>Tea Cozy (HTML/CSS/Flexbox)</h4>
                <img src="">
                    <figcaption>This project was my first attempt at using HTML, CSS and Flexbox to recreate a static website based on specific specs provided by codecademy. In addition, I learned to use a proper file system in order to stay organized throughout the entire project.</figcaption>
                <h4>Fotomatic (CSS Grid/ Media Queries)</h4>
                <img src="">
                    <figcaption>This project required me to use CSS Grid and media queroes to modify an existing page to add specific specs and convert the website from statis to respnosive. It was my time implementing media queries to see how a wedsbite is affected when screen sizes change.</figcaption>
                <h4>Business Site (HTML/CSS/Flexbox/Media Queries)</h4>
                <img src="">
                    <figcaption>This project was a personal favorite because I was able to create a website for mt girlfreind's up and coming business. I got to further practice creating a website from scratch and use a combination of HTML, CSS and primarily Flexbox to organize and style my page.</figcaption>
                <h4>Responsive Club Site (Media Queries)</h4>
                <img src="">
                    <figcaption>This project was also one of my favorite becuase I was able to add a personal touch once again. This project required me to dive deeper into making a website responsive by using media queries and relative units in CSS to position and size elements.</figcaption>
